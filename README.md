## 1 Abstract
Grand Vally State University students do not have a place to express their thoughts anonymously with their peers. LakerVent is a mobile application that empowers GVSU students to communicate without revealing their identity. Share your thoughts openly, categorize posts, and explore topics like academics, relationships, mental health, and more. Connect with peers through likes, comments, and supportive messages.

## 2 Introduction
With the rise in popularity of social media applications in the past decade, people have started to worry about what they post online and how their digital footprint may affect their future. Additionally, cyberbullying has become a significant problem with social media. Due to this, we introduce a new form of social media for anonymous posting so you can openly share your thoughts and opinions without any worries. The application will still have community guidelines that users need to follow, along with content monitoring to ensure a safe environment for everyone. LakerVent will provide a community for GVSU students to openly share their thoughts, easily find interesting posts through the implemented tagging system, and bring everyone closer together. The user just needs an Android or iOS device to join the LakeVent community.
