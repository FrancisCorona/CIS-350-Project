## 1 Abstract
Grand Vally State University students do not have a place to express their thoughts anonymously with their peers. LakerVent is a mobile application that empowers GVSU students to communicate without revealing their identity. With seamless account verification, you can join a secure community of fellow students. Share your thoughts openly, categorize posts, and explore topics like academics, relationships, mental health, and more. Connect with peers through likes, comments, and supportive messages.
